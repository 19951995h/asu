# Attendedsysupgrade Server (GSoC 2017)

This project intend to simplify the sysupgrade process of LEDE/LibreMesh. The provided tools here offer an easy way to reflash the router with a new release or package updates, without the need of `opkg` installed. 

## Active server

* [planetexpress](https://ledeupdate.planetexpress.cc) - thanks @egon0
* [libremesh](https://betaupdate.libremesh.org) - snapshots enabled

## Online Imagebuilder

Initially thought of as a demonstration to use the server API is an easy way to create custom images via a web interface. The imagebuilder is currently part of the server.

### Created LEDE packages

* [`rpcd-mod-attendedsysupgrade`](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/utils/rpcd-mod-attendedsysupgrade)

Offers a function to perform a sysupgrade via ubus. 

* [`rpcd-mod-packagelist`](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/utils/rpcd-mod-packagelist)

Has the function `list` to show all user installed packages without the need of `opkg` installed. 

* [`luci-app-attendedsysupgrade`](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/tree/master/applications/luci-app-attendedsysupgrade)

Add a view to the Luci system tab called "Attended Sysupgrade". Offers a button to search for updates and if found, to flash the image created by the update server. 

**Dependencies:**
* `rpcd`
	Used by both `rpcd-*` packages
* `uhttpd-mod-ubus`
	Communication between the Browser and the Router
* `cgi-io`
	Upload image from Browser to Router

### Server side

The server listens to update and image requests. Images are auto generated if the requests was valid. LEDE ImageBuilder is automatically setup up on first request of distribution, release, target & subtarget. 

All requests are stored in a queue and build by workers. 

## API

To communicate with the update server one have to distinguish between *upgrade check* and *upgrade request*. Both are explained below.

### Upgrade check `/api/upgrade-check`

Sends information about the device to the server to see if a new distribution release or package upgrades are available. An *upgrade check* could look like this:

| key 	| value | information 	|
| --- 	| --- 	| --- 		|
| `distro` | `LEDE` | installed distribution |
| `version` | `17.01.0` | installed release |
| `target` | `ar71xx` | |
| `subtarget` | `generic` | |
| `packages` | `{libuci-lua: 2017-04-12-c4df32b3-1, cgi-io: 3, ...}` | all user installed packages |

Most information can be retrieved via `ubus call system board`. Missing information can be gathered via the `rpcd-mod-packagelist` package.
`packages` contains all user installed packages. Packages installed as an dependence are excluded. 

It's also possible to check for a new release without sending packages by removing `packages` from the request.

### Check response

The server validates the request. Below is a possible response for a new release:

| key 		| value 	| information 	|
| --- 		| --- 		| --- 		|
| `version` 	| `17.01.2` 	| newest release |
| `updates` 	| `{luci-lib-jsonc: [git-17.230.25723-2163284-1, git-17.228.56579-209deb5-1], ...}` | Package updates `[new_version, current_version]` |
| `packages` 	| `[libuci-lua, cgi-io: 3, ...]` | All packages for the new image |

The client should check the status code:

| status 	| meaning 				| information 	|
| --- 		| --- 					| --- 			|
| 500 		| error					| see `error` in response | 
| 503 		| server overload	   		|  | 
| 204 		| no updates				| | 
| 201 		| imagebuilder not ready		| setting up imagebuilder, retry soon | 
| 200		| new release / new package updates	| see `version` and `updates` in response |

An release upgrade does not ignore package upgrades for the following reason. Between releases it possible that package names may change, packages are dropped or merged. The *reponse* contains all packages included changed ones.

### Upgrade request `/api/upgrade-request`

The *upgrade check response* should be shown to the user in a readable way. Once the user decides to perform the sysupgrade a new request is send to the server called *upgrade request*

| key 		| value 				| information 	|
| --- 		| --- 					| --- 		|
| `distro` 	| `LEDE` 				| installed distribution |
| `version`	| `17.01.2` 				| installed release |
| `target` 	| `ar71xx` 				| |
| `subtarget` 	| `generic` 				| |
| `board` 	| `tl-wdr4300-v1` 			| `board_name` of `ubus call system board` |
| `[model]` 	| `TP-Link TL-WDR4300 v1` 		| `model` of `ubus call system board`. This is optional and a fallback |
| `packages` 	| `[libuci-lua, cgi-io: 3, ...]` 	| All packages for the new image |

The *upgrade request* is nearly the same as the *upgrade check* before, except only containing package names without version and adding `board` and possibly `model`. While the server builds the requested image the clients keeps polling the server, sending *exacly* the same *image request*. The client _does not_ receive a ticket ID or anything similar. This is due to the situation when same devices poll in parallel only one build job is triggered, resulting in the same image for all devices.

### Response

| key 	| value | information 	|
| --- 	| --- 	| --- 		|
| `checksum` | `8b32f569dca8dcd780414f7850ed11e8` | md5 |
| `filesize` | `5570113` |  |
| `sysupgrade` | `https://betaupdate.libremesh.oâ€¦x86-64-Generic-sysupgrade.bin` | download link |

The `status` code has again different meanings.

| status 	| meaning 				| information 	|
| --- 		| --- 					| --- 			|
| 500		| build faild				| see `error`	|
| 503 		| server overload   			| please wait ~5 minutes | 
| 201		| queued				| requests wait to build |
| 206		| building				| building right now |
| 200		| ready					| build finished successful |

### Build request `/api/build-request`

It's also possible to request an imagebuild. The request is exaclty the same as for `upgrade-request`. The response only contains a link to the created `files`:

| key 		| value 	| information 	|
| --- 		| --- 		| --- 		|
| `files` 	| `https://betaupdate.libremesh.o...neric/af937867acd2951/` 	| files in json format |

This can be used to create a service like the *[Online Imagebuilder](https://ledeupdate.planetexpress.cc/imagebuilder)*
